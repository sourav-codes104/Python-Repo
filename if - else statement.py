# if statement
# The if statement tests a condition.
# If the condition is True, the block inside runs.
# If itâ€™s False, Python skips it

# elif (else if) statement
# Used when you have multiple conditions.
# Runs only if all previous conditions are False and the current one is True.
# You can have multiple elifs.

# else statement
# Acts as a default block.
# Executes when all previous conditions are False.
# You can only have one else at the end.
